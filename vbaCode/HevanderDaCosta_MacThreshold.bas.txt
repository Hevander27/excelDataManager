    ' This macro formats cells in a selected column based on user-defined thresholds.
    ' It prompts the user to input lower and upper threshold values, then applies
    ' color formatting to the font of cells that fall outside these thresholds.
    ' Values below or equal to the lower threshold are colored green, while values
    ' above or equal to the upper threshold are colored red. This visual formatting
    ' helps to quickly identify values that are below, above, or within the specified
    ' range, facilitating data analysis and highlighting key data points.
