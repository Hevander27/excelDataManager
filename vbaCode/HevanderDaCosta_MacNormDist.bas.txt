    ' This macro highlights cells in a selected range based on their statistical distribution.
    ' It calculates the mean and standard deviation of the numeric values in the range,
    ' then applies thick border formatting to cells that fall outside a user-specified
    ' number of standard deviations (sigma) from the mean. Values below the lower threshold
    ' are highlighted with a green border, while values above the upper threshold are
    ' highlighted with a red border. This helps to visually identify outliers or
    ' significant data points within a dataset, facilitating data analysis and interpretation.
